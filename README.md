We will be following Pythonâ€™s official naming conventions for directories and files, which means all folders and files must be named as lowercase values with words separated by underscores. For example, if I had a folder named My Documents, in Python I would name this folder my_documents.

module_1
assignment_1
assignment_2
assignment_3
